    <string name="bidirectionality_txt">A well-designed app can be easily localized for language scripts that are written and read from left-to-right (LTR), such as English, and for bidirectional language scripts.
        \n\nIn bidirectional scripts, text is written and read from right-to-left, but numbers and embedded words from LTR languages, such as non-localized names, are written left-to-right (LTR). Bidirectional scripts include Arabic, Hebrew, and Persian.
        \n\nBidirectionality affects not only the layout of text and UI elements but also iconography. This section provides basic, high-level information about how to consider bidirectionality in design.
