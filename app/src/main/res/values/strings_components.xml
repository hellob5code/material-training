        \n\nCards have a constant width and variable height. The maximum height is limited to the height of the available space on a platform, but it can temporarily expand (for example, to display a comment field). Cards do not flip over to reveal information on the back.

    <!-- Dialogs Fragment -->
    <string name="dialogs">Dialogs</string>
    <string name="dialogs_txt">Dialogs inform users about critical information, require users to make decisions, or encapsulate multiple tasks within a discrete process. Use dialogs sparingly because they are interruptive in nature. Their sudden appearance forces users to stop their current task and refocus on the dialog content. Not every choice, setting, or detail warrants interruption and prominence.
        \n\nAlternatives to dialogs include menus or inline expansion within the current content area. Both approaches present non-interruptive options while maintaining the current context.

    <!-- Pickers Fragment -->
    <string name="pickers">Pickers</string>
    <string name="pickers_txt">Pickers provide a simple way to select a single value from a set.
        \n\nEach picker is a dialog with a set of controls for entering the units of the date (month, day, year) or time (hour, minute, AM/PM). Using these components in your app helps ensure that a user\'s specification of a date or time input is valid and formatted correctly. The format of a time and date picker adjusts automatically to the locale, i.e. month-day-year in the US and day-month-year in other regions.
        \n\nOn mobile, pickers are best suited for display in a dialog. For inline display, such as on a form, consider using compact controls such as text fields or dropdown menus.

Sliders can have icons to the left and right of the bar that reflect the value intensity. The interactive nature of the slider makes it a great choice for settings that reflect intensity levels, such as volume, brightness, or color saturation.</string>

    <string name="snackbars_and_toasts_txt">Snackbars provide lightweight feedback about an operation. They show a brief message at the bottom of the screen. Snackbars appear above most elements on screen, are equal in elevation to the floating action button, and lower in elevation to dialogs, bottom sheets, and navigation drawers. Snackbars can contain an action.
        \n\nSnackbars animate upwards from the bottom edge of the screen. They automatically disappear after a timeout or after user interaction elsewhere on the screen, particularly after interactions that summon a new surface or activity. Snackbars can be swiped off screen. They do not block input on the screens on which they appear. Show only one snackbar on screen at a time.
        \n\nAndroid also provides a toast, primarily used for system messaging. Toasts are similar to snackbars but do not contain actions and cannot be swiped off screen.

    <!-- Text Fields Fragment -->
    <string name="text_fields">Text fields</string>
    <string name="text_fields_txt">Text fields allow the user to input text. They can be single line, with or without scrolling, or multi-line, and can have an icon. Touching a text field places the cursor and automatically displays the keyboard. In addition to typing, text fields allow for a variety of other tasks, such as text selection (cut, copy, paste) and data lookup via auto-completion. See Patterns > Selection for text selection design.
        \n\nThe type of text field determines what kind of characters are allowed inside the field and may prompt the virtual keyboard to optimize its layout for frequently used characters. Common types for which you should optimize include number, text, email address, phone number, person’s name, username, URL, street address, credit card number, PIN, and search query.
